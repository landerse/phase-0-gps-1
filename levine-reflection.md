#Version Control and Git Reflection
## Jordan Levine
GPS 1.1
Release 7

Prior to this GPS session, I was struggling with the following git concepts:

*I wasn't sure about the origin keyword
*I had not yet dived into resolving merge conflicts, so I didn't know anything about that
*I was doing some reading about how pointers work when several commits are issued. I didn't grasp fully what they were talking about.

During this GPS session, the following concepts were clarified:
*Origin is an alias and refers to the remote repository
*I learned a lot about how to use google hangout with screen sharing and using my Mac - I am hamstrung by an unfamiliar OS, and it is tricky doing even the simplist thing
*I learned all the basics of merge conflict.
* I learned that just adding a collaborator isn't enough to give access to a repo; the collaborator needs a link to the repository too.
* I learned that I should use double quotes and not single quotes when writing commit messages.

Questions I asked my pair and guide:
* I asked a lot of navigational questions relating to all of the tools we were using to communicate
* I asked about pull request review processes - when commenting on one line of code, when you click the buttons like Submit Review (or something like that - I don't remember the exact button names), you are only submitting stuff about that one line of code. You can have a whole conversation between collaborators about just one line of code.
* I learned that commit messages should be in present tense and start with a capital, by convention.
* I learned that when reviewing code changes for a pull request review, pink means deleted and green means new.

What still confuses me:
* merging locally vs. on github
* why you can use git pull alone instead of git pull <repo name>

How was my first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I learned a lot, but I was crippled by my inexperience with my Mac and all of the new programs that I didn't know how to navigate. My guide and pair were both patient and helpful, but I was slowing us way down with all the technical stuff. Also, I kept stopping both my pair and guide to ask a question or to slow down and try to understand stuff. They were both ready to be productive, but I was more in learning/understanding mode. I felt pressure (from myself, not them) to learn fast, and that made the learning environment stressful and not enjoyable for me. I will work on getting more familiar with all of the tools, and I will also do more studying before the GPS so that I don't have to absorb all of the concepts for the first time.
