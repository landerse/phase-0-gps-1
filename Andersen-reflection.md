#Release 7: Reflect
* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - Pull requests were a little bit confusing, but that's about it.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - Pull requests!
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - I asked why use fetch and merge instead of just pull, and my guide answered it thoroughly. I didn't have any questions for my pair.
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - I think I understand it pretty well so far, but I'm sure I'll have some trouble down the road a bit.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - To be honest, a little bit frustrating. My pair spent at least half of the time with our guide setting up their computer, so we didn't get much time with the guide, and it seems like my pair might have needed a tutorial on how to use their computer before jumping into coding.
